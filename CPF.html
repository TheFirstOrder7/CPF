</p>
            <p><strong>(b):</strong>Delinquency Charges: A late payment fee of [25 percent] shall be levied on contributions received after the stipulated deadline. Persistent delinquency, defined as [3] consecutive missed payments, will result in:

(i) Temporary Suspension: Loss of voting rights (only in matters related to the governance of this fund) and eligibility for loans and benefits until all outstanding contributions and fees are settled.

(ii) Termination: Involuntary Membership termination after [6] months of suspension, with subsequent ineligibility for re-enrollment until all liabilities are cleared.
</p>
            <p><strong>5A:</strong>  Pursuant to the stipulations set forth in Article 5(a), voluntary contributions are encouraged through the imposition of an additional annualised remuneration commitment of 2.5 percent, in addition to the obligatory contribution already undertaken at a rate of 5 percent per annum. This results in a cumulative interest rate of 7.5 percent on said voluntary contributions.
