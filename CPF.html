                        <p> <strong>Statement of Objects and Reasons:</strong></p>
                        <p>The proposed amendment to the scheme is driven by a critical deficiency in the fund allocation for loan disbursement. The prevailing monthly obligation of ₹50 has proven inadequate in accommodating the escalating demand for loans and maintaining operational efficacy. Thus, there exists an exigent need to augment the monthly obligation to ₹100 to fortify the scheme's capacity to fulfil its mandate of extending financial support to eligible beneficiaries. This adjustment is essential to uphold the scheme's integrity, efficacy, and long-term viability, thereby safeguarding its ability to serve its intended purpose effectively.</p>
                        <p>¹- Article 2(a) - Nothing in this shall be deemed invalid notwithstanding the contravention of Article 2, also to subsist the constitutionality of the above cited objects and reasons the monthly obligation stand increased to ₹100.</p>

                    <div class="content" id="content2">
                        <p><strong>Statement of Objects and Reasons:</strong></p>
                        <p>Pursuant to the powers vested in the Treasurer by Article 11 (e), for the purpose of effectuating the directives set forth in Article 6 (c). The Treasurer's Office on its own discretion shall set forth amendments as it desires to promote greater inclusivity and accessibility of its lending operations; Whereas, the current interpretation of Members may inadvertently restrict participation;</p>
                        <p><strong>Now, Therefore, be it resolved by the Treasurer's Office, as follows:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Broad Construction of "Members":</strong> The term "Members," as used in all policies and procedures governing the lending operations, shall be construed in a broad and inclusive manner, consistent with the spirit of promoting access and participation. This broad construction shall encompass any individual or entity demonstrably meeting the objective criteria for membership, regardless of any potentially restrictive prior interpretations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Commentary:</strong> The amendment promised a brighter future for the scheme. Its proponents envisioned waves of new participants flooding the program, propelled by the reimagined definition of "Members." Critics, however, voiced concerns. They cautioned that the loosened standards might invite misuse, diluting the program's original intent and potentially draining its resources. The Treasurer's Office pledged vigilance, promising to carefully calibrate the eligibility criteria to achieve a balance between inclusion and responsible stewardship. Only time would reveal whether the gamble would prove a visionary act or an ill-conceived miscalculation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Abbreviation:</strong> (to be valid for the whole of the document)</p>
                        <p><strong>Member</strong> (upper case ‘M’ and all its variants) - includes all those who have been registered and enrolled into the collective prosperity fund.</p>

                        <p>²- Article 7(a) - Nothing in this shall be deemed invalid notwithstanding the contravention of Article 7, also to subsist the constitutionality of the above cited objects and reasons the term Member shall be read down as members for only lending operations.</p>

                        <p><strong>Statement of Objects and Reasons:</strong></p>
                        <p>The Fourth Constitutional Amendment, 2024, was initiated to address certain lacunae in the existing constitutional framework of the First Order. It aims to streamline the governance structure, enhance the clarity of legal provisions, and strengthen democratic processes within the territory.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Definition of State and Fundamental Laws:</strong></p>
                        <p>The amendment clarifies the definition of "the State" and establishes the supremacy of fundamental laws enlisted in the First Schedule. It ensures that any law inconsistent with or derogatory to these fundamental laws is rendered void. This provision safeguards the constitutional principles and fundamental rights enshrined in the legal framework of the First Order.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Amendment Procedure and Presidential Powers:</strong></p>
                        <p>To facilitate a more efficient amendment procedure, the amendment empowers the President to introduce public or private bills for ratification in the Legislative Council. This streamlines the process while ensuring the preservation of democratic principles. Additionally, the President is entrusted with executive powers, including the authority to promulgate ordinances and seek legal opinions from the Supreme Court on matters of public importance.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Presidential Election Process:</strong></p>
                        <p>The amendment outlines the process for the election of the President, ensuring that any eligible member willing to abide by the constitution can assume the presidential office for a specified period. The establishment of a statutory body to oversee presidential elections ensures transparency and fairness in the electoral process.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Supreme Court Provisions:</strong></p>
                        <p>Notably, the amendment introduces provisions regarding the Supreme Court, including the appointment of an Ad hoc Chief Justice for specific cases and the facilitation of pre-litigation mediation by the President. It also grants the Supreme Court expansive powers in interpreting the constitution and issuing writs against the State, thereby upholding the rule of law and ensuring access to justice for all citizens.</p>
                        <p>The enactment of this amendment was carried out under the directive of the Honourable Courts, signifying the commitment to upholding constitutional principles and ensuring the effective functioning of democratic institutions within the First Order. It reflects a concerted effort to strengthen governance, protect fundamental rights, and promote the rule of law, thereby fostering a more just and equitable society.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Fourth Constitutional Amendment, 2024, represents a significant step towards enhancing the governance framework and institutional mechanisms within the First Order, in line with the principles of democracy, justice, and constitutionalism.</p>
