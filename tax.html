        <h1>Comprehensive Taxation Policy</h1>
        <h2>President Office</h2>
        <h2>Date: 23/05/2024</h2>
        <h3>Policy Title: Comprehensive Taxation Policy for the First Order Fund - Collective Prosperity Fund</h3>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 23/05/2024</p>

        <h3>Policy Overview</h3>
        <p>The President's Office of the First Order hereby establishes a comprehensive taxation framework for the Collective Prosperity Fund. This policy encompasses both retrospective and prospective taxation on monthly receipts derived from interest, fines, and other transactions leading to fund augmentation, while explicitly excluding voluntary and mandatory deposits. The primary objective is to promote fairness and efficiency in tax collection, thereby fostering collective prosperity.</p>

        <h3>Key Highlights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scope of Taxable Transactions:</strong> Inclusive taxation on past and future monthly receipts from interest, fines, and any transactions augmenting the fund. Exemptions for voluntary and mandatory deposits.</li>
            <li><strong>Threshold for Taxation:</strong> Tax applies only to amounts resulting in whole numbers. Establishes a minimum threshold for taxation based on accrued amounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Rate:</strong> A flat tax rate of one-third (1/3) of the taxable amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Collection Schedule:</strong> Taxes must be remitted before the 13th day of each month.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance and Reporting Requirements:</strong> Mandatory reporting and detailed record-keeping for all taxable transactions. Regular audits and penalties for non-compliance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Detailed Provisions</h3>
        <h4>1. Scope of Taxable Transactions</h4>
        <p>Taxable receipts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monthly interest from investments, savings, or other financial instruments.</li>
            <li>Fines received from any source.</li>
            <li>Other transactions resulting in fund augmentation, with voluntary and mandatory deposits being exempt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Taxation applies retrospectively (to previous periods) and prospectively (to current and future periods).</p>

        <h4>2. Threshold for Taxation</h4>
        <p>Taxation is applicable to amounts accruing in whole numbers. This threshold simplifies tax processes and excludes minor fractional amounts.</p>

        <h4>3. Tax Rate</h4>
        <p>The tax rate is uniformly set at one-third (33.33%) of the taxable amount. This rate applies consistently across all qualifying transactions.</p>

        <h4>4. Tax Collection Schedule</h4>
        <p>Taxpayers are required to calculate and remit due taxes before the 13th day of each month. This ensures timely and consistent tax collection.</p>

        <h4>5. Compliance and Reporting Requirements</h4>
        <p>Taxpayers must maintain comprehensive records of all taxable transactions. Monthly reports detailing taxable amounts and taxes paid must be submitted to the tax authority. The tax authority will conduct regular audits to ensure compliance. Penalties for late payment, underpayment, or non-compliance will be enforced, based on U.S. taxation compliance models.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This comprehensive taxation policy for the Collective Prosperity Fund aims to enhance fairness and efficiency in tax collection, covering both retrospective and prospective receipts from interest, fines, and other transactions augmenting the fund. With clear guidelines, robust compliance measures, and a commitment to transparency, this policy seeks to support the collective prosperity of the First Order.</p>
